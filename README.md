## Description

A program created with Java where a player is presented with a random word from
a library and can enter letters to guess the word. If the letter is present than
it appears in the unknown word and if not a piece of the hangman's body is presented
which represents the turns the player has left. And if the letter has been guessed
before than the program lets the player know but it doesn't take a turn from him
instead.
